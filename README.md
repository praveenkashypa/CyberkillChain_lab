Objectives & learning outcomes

After completing the lab and using materials in this repo you should be able to:

Understand the stages of the Cyber Kill Chain and map typical attacker activities to each stage.

Perform reconnaissance, scanning, and basic enumeration of a target VM.

Identify and exploit simple misconfigurations (where applicable to the lab).

Document findings clearly and produce a professional lab write-up.

Improve familiarity with common pentesting tools and methodology.

How to use this repo / lab workflow

Read the lab PDF (included) to understand the tasks and scope.

Cyber_Kill-Chain:-
Start the TryHackMe machine (or lab environment) and connect via the provided method (the TryHackMe VPN or web-based machine).

Create a fresh working directory for your notes (or use writeup/ in this repo).

Follow the standard pentest flow:

Reconnaissance (passive → active)

Scanning (ports/services)

Enumeration (service-specific)

Exploitation (if the lab requires)

Post-exploitation and cleanup (notes only)

Save commands, outputs, screenshots, and final flags to screenshots/.

Draft the final write-up in writeup/final.md using the template below.
